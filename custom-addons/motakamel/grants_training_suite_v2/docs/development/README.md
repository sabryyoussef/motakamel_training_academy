# Grants Training Suite V2

## 🎯 Module Overview

**Grants Training Suite V2** is a comprehensive training center management system built for Odoo 18.0 Enterprise. This module handles the complete workflow from grant intake to certification and post-grant monetization.

## 📋 Development Approach

This module is being developed using a **lazy steps and phases** approach:

### 🚀 Phase 1: Main Module with Dependencies
- [x] Create basic module structure
- [x] Set up manifest with dependencies
- [x] Create basic __init__.py
- [x] Test module installation
- [x] Track any installation errors

### 🔧 Phase 2: Backend Models (Step by Step) - ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Model 1: Intake Batch - COMPLETED
- [x] Model 2: Student - COMPLETED
- [x] Model 3: Assignment - COMPLETED
- [x] Model 4: Document Request - COMPLETED
- [x] Model 5: Course Session - COMPLETED
- [x] Model 6: Homework Attempt - COMPLETED
- [x] Model 7: Certificate - COMPLETED

### 🎨 Phase 3: Frontend Views (One by One) - ⏳ READY TO START
- [ ] View 1: Intake Batch Views
- [ ] View 2: Student Views
- [ ] View 3: Assignment Views
- [ ] View 4: Document Request Views
- [ ] View 5: Course Session Views
- [ ] View 6: Homework Attempt Views
- [ ] View 7: Certificate Views
- [ ] Dashboard and Reporting Views
- [ ] Menu Structure and Navigation

## 🎉 Phase 2 Completion Summary

### ✅ All 7 Backend Models Successfully Created and Tested

**Models Implemented:**
1. **`gr.intake.batch`** - File upload and student import with validation
2. **`gr.student`** - Student management with eligibility assessment
3. **`gr.assignment`** - Student-to-agent assignment with workflow tracking
4. **`gr.document.request`** - Document collection with review system
5. **`gr.course.session`** - Course session management with attendance
6. **`gr.homework.attempt`** - Homework submission and grading system
7. **`gr.certificate`** - Certificate generation and verification

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Complete workflow management for all models
- File upload/download capabilities
- Automatic sequence generation
- Comprehensive validation and constraints
- Mail integration for notifications
- Full security configuration with 4 user groups
- Performance metrics and reporting fields
- Integration between all models

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Module loaded successfully in 0.79s
- ✅ 205 queries executed without errors
- ✅ All security rules and ACLs working
- ✅ All sequences generating properly
- ✅ Complete model integration verified
- ✅ Zero errors in final integration test

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Error Tracking
- Each phase has dedicated error tracking
- Errors are logged immediately when detected
- Resolution process documented
- Prevention measures implemented

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Monitor Odoo logs
tail -f /home/sabry3/odoo-dev/logs/odoo.log

# Check for module-specific errors
tail -f /home/sabry3/odoo-dev/logs/odoo.log | grep grants_training_suite_v2

# Monitor error tracking files
tail -f error_tracking/*.log
```

### Demo Data Verification (MANDATORY RULE)
- After adding or updating any demo XML, always verify that records were created.
- Option A — Odoo shell counts (recommended):
```bash
python3 odoo-18/odoo18/odoo-bin shell -c /home/sabry3/odoo-dev/odoo_conf/odoo.conf -d courses2 -c "
print('intake', env['gr.intake.batch'].search_count([]))
print('student', env['gr.student'].search_count([]))
print('assignment', env['gr.assignment'].search_count([]))
print('document', env['gr.document.request'].search_count([]))
print('session', env['gr.course.session'].search_count([]))
print('homework', env['gr.homework.attempt'].search_count([]))
print('certificate', env['gr.certificate'].search_count([]))
"
```
- Option B — SQL counts (psql):
```bash
psql -h localhost -U odoo18 -d courses2 -c "
SELECT 'gr_intake_batch' tbl, COUNT(*) FROM gr_intake_batch
UNION ALL SELECT 'gr_student', COUNT(*) FROM gr_student
UNION ALL SELECT 'gr_assignment', COUNT(*) FROM gr_assignment
UNION ALL SELECT 'gr_document_request', COUNT(*) FROM gr_document_request
UNION ALL SELECT 'gr_course_session', COUNT(*) FROM gr_course_session
UNION ALL SELECT 'gr_homework_attempt', COUNT(*) FROM gr_homework_attempt
UNION ALL SELECT 'gr_certificate', COUNT(*) FROM gr_certificate;"
```
Acceptance: counts should be at least the number of demo records defined for each model.

## 🚨 Error Resolution Process

1. **Stop Development** - Don't continue to next step
2. **Document Error** - Log error with full context
3. **Analyze Cause** - Identify root cause
4. **Implement Fix** - Apply solution
5. **Test Fix** - Verify error is resolved
6. **Continue Development** - Only proceed after fix

## 📊 Current Status

**Phase 1**: ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Module structure created
- [x] Manifest file created
- [x] Init file created
- [x] Installation testing completed
- [x] Error tracking setup complete
- [x] All dependencies verified and working

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Start Phase 2 Development**
   - Begin with Model 1: Intake Batch
   - Test each model individually
   - Track errors systematically

2. **Continue Step-by-Step Approach**
   - Create models one by one
   - Test after each model
   - Use error tracking system
